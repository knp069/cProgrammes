# cProgrammes
A colletion of different c programs of different domains

Repository contains many c programs of various domains like Backtracking , trees , Linked List etc.

you can find them in their in their respective folders

All the programs in this repository has been coded by me and are writeen purely in c .
they have been tested and they work as expected.


list of programmes :-
